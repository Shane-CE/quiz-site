    <h2>Living on a Small Island</h2>
    <p>My name is Ben and I’m 17. I live on a small island near Ireland. It’s 5 km long with only 200 people. When I was a child, life was great. On small islands, everybody knows everybody, so I always had someone to be with. I played in the fields and on the beach. I went swimming. I even learned to drive on my uncle’s farm when I was 11.</p>
    <p>I’ve always enjoyed going to school here. There are only three in my class so we each get lots of time with the teacher. She doesn’t live on the island. Sometimes, if the weather is bad, she can’t get here, but we still have lessons online. The internet is great for us. We can have friends all over the world and chat and play computer games with them.</p>
    <p>I had some difficult times when I first became a teenager. I felt that there wasn’t enough for me to do. I even thought about leaving the island because I wanted to have interesting experiences and meet new people. But I decided to stay and now I’m planning to live here when I grow up.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there aren’t many jobs for young people. When I was little, most men were fishermen, like Dad, or farmers, like my uncle. Now there are just a few fishermen. It can be difficult. I’ve been fishing with Dad sometimes, but I always feel sick on a boat, so I might prefer farming.</p>
